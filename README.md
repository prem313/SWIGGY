## Swiggy Food Delivery App using React Native

Welcome to the Swiggy Food Delivery App project built using React Native. This project aims to create a user-friendly and efficient food delivery app similar to the popular Swiggy app. Users can browse through a variety of restaurants, select their favorite dishes, place orders, and have their food delivered to their doorstep.

Features:
* Browse Restaurants: Users can explore a list of restaurants available on the platform. Each restaurant displays its menu, ratings, and delivery time.

* Search Functionality: Users can search for specific restaurants, cuisines, or dishes using the search bar.

* Menu Viewing: Users can view the detailed menu of a selected restaurant. The menu includes various categories of dishes, along with their descriptions and prices.

* Cart Management: Users can add multiple dishes to their cart, specify quantities, and remove items if needed.

* Order Placement: Users can place orders for the selected dishes. Orders are confirmed with an order summary, estimated delivery time, and total cost.

* Order Tracking: Users can track the status of their orders in real-time, from preparation to delivery.
